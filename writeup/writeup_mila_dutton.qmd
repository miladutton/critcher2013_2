## Introduction

This paper examines how the speed in making moral decisions can shape how others view as, as well as how we assess our own actions. The intersection between decision making and moral cognition touches on the core psychological questions regarding ethics, thought process, and social environments.

The experiment will follow the structure of the original study by having participants read stories regarding making moral decisions at varying speeds. In experiment 1, two men find separate wallets in a parking lot. One man immediately decides what to do with the wallet while the other decides after a "long and careful deliberation". In the moral condition, both men turn the wallet in, and in the immoral decision both men keep the wallet. Participants are then given questionnaires in which they rank the following sets: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity. In this study, I only replicated experiment 1. For analysis, A two way ANOVA test was run to assess decision speed and type of decision.

A potential challenge is that I do not have experience with this type of data analysis so it will definitely be a learning curve. I am confident in my ability to learn, but I am sure it will take a bit to feel confident doing so.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The original study utilizes a series of analyses to determine the interaction between dependent and independent variables.

-   **Decision on Moral Character:** A significant main effect of decision type (F(1, 117) = 541.52, p \< .001) revealed that Justin, who decided quickly (M = 6.44, SE = .08), was perceived differently from Nate (M = 2.15, SE = .12). Moral decision also influenced character evaluation (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with returning the wallet seen as morally better.

-   **Decision Speed and Emotional Impulsivity:** Justin was viewed as less emotionally impulsive (M = 2.40, SE = .11) than Nate (M = 3.79, SE = .12), (F(1, 117) = 95.26, p \< .001), but this did not affect moral evaluations (t \< 1).

-   **Decision Speed and Moral Evaluation Polarization:** The Decision × Speed interaction was significant (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with quick immoral decisions leading to more negative evaluations (t(54) = 8.28, p \< .001) and quick moral decisions to more positive evaluations (t(63) = 7.71, p \< .001).

-   **Certainty as a Mediator:** Quick decisions were associated with higher certainty (F(1, 117) = 706.6, p \< .001). Certainty mediated the relationship between decision speed and moral evaluation, with greater certainty explaining more negative evaluations for immoral decisions and more positive evaluations for moral ones.

I planned to perform power analyses to determine the sample sizes needed to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power for detecting effect sizes from the original study. However, the original study did not give exact effect sizes, difference between means, or error bars. For that reason, I was unable to perform a power analysis and determine sample size through that methodology.

### Planned Sample

Based on the original studies findings, I planned to have a sample size of approximately 298 participants. This is 2.5 times the original sample size n = 119. However, due to funding I ended up doing 1/3 of that, with a sample size of n = 100, and the combining data with the other two groups who replicated the same study. The sampling frame consisted of individuals in the participant pool on the website Prolific. The only pre selection rule was that participants must be fluent in English and be approved for at least 98% of the studies they applied to.

### Materials

Participants in this study were presented with a story focusing on two men, as outlined in the original article. Through reaching out to the original researchers, I was able to get access to their exact materials. The story was structured as follows.

"Justin and Nate were walking to separate cars in the parking lot of Andronico’s, a local grocery store, when they each spotted a different lost wallet next to their cars. Upon picking up the wallet and looking inside, each found several hundred dollars in cash. Each man considered whether he should return the wallet and money to the Customer Service desk at Andronico’s, or pocket the money and drive away."

**Moral Condition**

"Justin saw his decision as an easy one and was able to decide quickly. He did not steal the money and instead left the wallet with Customer Service."

"In contrast, Nate saw his decision as difficult and was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation. After several minutes of thinking in his car, he too decided not to steal the money and instead left the wallet with Customer Service."

**Immoral Condition**

"Justin saw his decision as an easy one and was able to decide quickly. He pocketed the money and drove off."

"In contrast, Nate saw his decision as difficult and was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation. After several minutes of thinking in his car, he too decided to pocket the money and drive off."

Immediately following the description of Justin and Nate’s actions, participants answered a series of questions related to the men’s moral character evaluation. These questions were rated on a 1-7 scale. These questions were also taken directly from the original research.

-   **Quickness (manipulation check)**:

    -   Q0: Did \[Character\] make his decision quickly or slowly? (1 = particularly slowly, 7 = particularly quickly)

-   **Moral Character Evaluation**:

    -   Q1: Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, does it sound like \[Character\] has underlying moral principles that are good, bad, or somewhere in between? (1 = completely bad, 4 = mixed, 7 = completely good)
    -   Q2: Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, do you think Justin has moral standards that are good, bad, or somewhere in between? (1 = completely bad, 4 = mixed, 7 = completely good)
    -   Q3: Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, do you think Justin possesses the moral knowledge and principles necessary to do ‘the right thing’? (1 = not at all, 4 = somewhat, 7 = completely)

-   **Certainty**:

    -   Q4: Would you say \[Character\] was quite certain in his decision, or did \[Character\] have hesitations about his or her decision? (1 = completely certain, 7 = considerable hesitations)
    -   Q5: How close do you think \[Character\] was to choosing the alternate course of action? (1 = very close to, 7 = not close at all)
    -   Q6: How conflicted do you think \[Character\] felt in making the decision? (1 = very conflicted, 7 = not at all conflicted)
    -   Q7: Based on the information provided, do you think \[Character\] had many reservations about the decision? (1 = none at all, 7 = a whole lot)

-   **Emotional impulsivity**:

    -   Q8: Do you think \[Character\] was calm and emotionally contained while making the decision? (1 = not at all, 7 = entirely so)
    -   Q9: To what extent do you think \[Character\] became upset and acted without thinking? (1 = not at all, 7 = entirely so)

-   **Note**:

    -   These materials were used **precisely** as outlined in the original article without deviations.

### Procedure

-   Participants are randomly assigned to the moral or immoral decision.

    -   Moral decision: Justin and Nate both decide not to steal the money and return the wallets.

    -   Immoral decision: Justin and Nate both decide to keep the money and drive off.

-   Participants read about both Justin and Nate, who found wallets in the parking lot. "Justin 'was able to decide quickly' what to do. Nate 'was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation.'"

-   Participants rate their quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity on a likert scale.

-   Participants answer attention check to confirm their attention in the study.

### Analysis Plan

The main focus of this study is to evaluate moral character judgments based on decision type and decision speed. After collecting the data, I excluded participants who met the exclusion criteria.

For the statistical analysis, my primary question of interest involved testing the effect of two factors (decision speed and decision type) on moral character judgments. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the main effects and interaction effects, adjusting for all other variables in the model. Effect sizes, such as partial eta-squared, were calculated to interpret the magnitude of these effects.

The results of the ANOVA were visualized using several approaches. Bar plots with error bars were used to compare mean moral scores across conditions, providing a clear depiction of differences between groups. Box plots highlighted the distribution of moral scores within each condition, revealing variability and potential outliers. Interaction plots illustrated how the relationship between decision speed and moral character evaluation varied across decision types, offering a visual representation of significant interaction effects. These methods allowed for a comprehensive and nuanced interpretation of the data.

### Design Overview

-   Two factors were manipulated: decision type and decision speed.

-   Four measures were taken: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, emotional impulsivity.

-   It was a within subjects design.

-   Measures were not repeated.

-   There was no mention of steps taken to reduce demand characteristics.

-   Participants with previous traumatic exposure to a relevant situation or personal ties may have strong feelings regarding moral evaluation, which may serve as a confounding variable.

### Differences from Original Study

The main difference from the original study is that I performed one experiment rather than two. Specifically, I replicated experiment 1.

The participant pool was also different. The original paper included mainly undergraduate students at UC Berkeley, as well as members from the surrounding community. As I am not a part of that institution, my participants were not from that community. I conducted this study entirely online, unlike the original study, which did not specify whether participants were tested in a lab or online. Using Prolific, I did not impose any regional restrictions, which meant I could not control the exact environment in which participants completed the study.

Lastly, I added an attention check at the end of the questions which the original study did not have. This was to ensure that participants were not just clicking through, and to help minimize bots. These differences were not expected to make a difference in obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

After collecting and cleaning my data, I decided to handle missing values through list wise deletion. This approach, which removes participants with missing data for any variable included in the analysis, was not part of my original plan but was implemented to maintain a consistent data set for all statistical tests. While this method reduced the sample size slightly, it ensured that all analyses were conducted on complete cases, preserving the validity of the results.

#### Actual Sample

After cleaning the data and excluding invalid participants, I had a sample size of n = 96. After combing my data with the other groups and cleaning it, I had a final sample size of n = 207. I did not collect any demographic information.

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

None.

## Results

### Data preparation

To prepare the data set for analysis, I implemented a detailed cleaning process to ensure its integrity and reliability. A manual check for missing values were removed to maintain data quality, however none were found. Participants who met any one part the exclusion criteria were also removed.

The exclusion criteria is as follows:

-   Failed the manipulation check

-   Failed the attention check

-   Completed the study in less than 1.5 minutes

-   Had the same response to every question

A condition column was added to categorize scenarios into moral or immoral decisions. Responses were parsed to extract structured data from JSON format, handling invalid responses to avoid errors. The data set was then reshaped into a long format, which allowed for easier analysis. Composite scores for moral evaluations were calculated for each character, providing a clear and structured summary of the data. These steps ensured the data set was properly formatted, high-quality, and ready for statistical analysis and visualization.

My data set was then combined with the data from the other two groups. Due to different cleaning techniques some of the original structure from my data set was lost in integration with the new one. This new combined data set had missing values, so those were dropped. The Mean moral composite score was recalculated again and columns for speed and character were added.

### Confirmatory analysis

A two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the main effects of decision type (whether participants decided to return or keep the wallet) and decision speed (quick or slow) on the moral character evaluation. This analysis allowed me to assess how these factors independently influenced moral judgments, both independently and when interacting.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# ANOVA for just my group data 
# Perform Two-Way ANOVA
anova_results <- aov(moral_score ~ condition * decision_speed, data = final_dataset)

# Display the ANOVA table
summary(anova_results)

#Condition has a strong and significant main effect on moral_score.
#Decision_Speed alone does not significantly affect moral_score.
#There is a significant interaction effect between condition and decision_speed, meaning the influence of condition on moral_score changes depending on the level of decision_speed.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

The primary result of the confirmatory analysis in this replication showed a significant interaction effect between decision type (whether participants decided to return or keep the wallet) and decision speed (quick vs. slow) on moral character evaluation, consistent with the original findings. Specifically, the interaction effect was significant (F(1, 410) = 191.8, p \< 2e-16), confirming that quick moral decisions received more positive evaluations than slow moral decisions, and quick immoral decisions were judged more harshly than slow immoral decisions. This finding is comparable to the original finding of F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001.

Similarly, the original paper also found a significant effect of decision type on moral character evaluation. In the original study, the main effect of decision type was significant (F(1, 117) = 417.07, p \< .001) and explained much of the variance in moral character evaluations, demonstrating that moral decisions were evaluated more positively than immoral ones. In the replication, the effect of decision type was also significant (F(1, 410) = 315.4, p \< 2e-16) and similarly strong, confirming that moral decisions received higher moral character evaluations compared to immoral ones.

This replication successfully captured the ideas of the original finding, which demonstrated that decision speed influenced the perceived moral character of individuals, with quick decisions being interpreted as reflecting greater certainty and thus more polarized moral evaluations. Therefore, the replication can be categorized as a partial replication of the original result, as the primary interaction effect was consistent, but additional analyses, such as emotional impulsivity or mediation through perceived certainty, were not evaluated.

### Commentary

### Insights from Follow-Up Exploratory Analysis

In the exploratory analyses, the replication confirmed the interaction effect between decision type and decision speed, consistent with the original study. However, the non significant effect of decision speed (F(1, 410) = 0.0, p = 0.987) suggests that the speed of the decision alone does not influence moral character evaluation. Decision speed only has a significant effect on moral character evaluation when interacting with decision type. This highlights that the moral nature of the decision is a stronger determinant of judgments than the speed at which the decision is made.

### Assessment of the Meaning of the Replication

This replication is successful in reproducing the key findings of the original study, particularly the significant interaction between decision type and speed. However, slight differences in effect sizes could be attributed to the larger sample size in this study (n = 207 compared to n = 118 in the original). While the replication used the same moral character evaluation measures, minor procedural differences, such as the participant pool, experimental environment, or even cultural contexts, could explain any small differences. Importantly, the replicated findings strengthen the argument that quick decisions are perceived as more certain and thus more polarizing in moral contexts.

**Objections or Challenges Raised:**\
One potential challenge in the replication is the decision to handle missing data through list wise deletion, which could reduce variability in the data set. Additionally, while the replication focused solely on decision type and speed, the original study may have included mediating variables (e.g., perceived certainty or emotional impulsivity) that were not tested here. No direct objections from the original authors have been raised.
